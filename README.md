This repository demonstrates a common error when building Docker images: a missing or incorrectly referenced requirements file. The initial Dockerfile (Dockerfile) attempts to install dependencies using pip3 install -r requirements.txt, but the requirements.txt file is either missing from the context or is in a different location than specified.  The solution (Dockerfile.fixed) corrects this by ensuring the requirements.txt file is correctly included and referenced.
